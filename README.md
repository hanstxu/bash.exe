# bash.exe

bash commands for windows implemented with C++ and the Windows API

For now, I'll just include the sources files and not all the extra
files that Visual Studio includes with every project (e.g. project
configuration). They are compiled using the Visual Studio C++ compiler.
Once built, the executables can be found in the **Debug** folder of your
Visual Studio project. You can then paste them into **C:\Windows** or
**C:\Windows\System32** so that they can be run anywhere in the command prompt.

This is a low-priority project so I'll work on it when I have free time.
